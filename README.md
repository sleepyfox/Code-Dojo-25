Code Dojo 25
============
This is example code for the London Code Dojo's 25th meetup on August 12th, 2013. We were using the 'Roman numeral' kata.

The tests can be run from the command-line with [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/):
	
	mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script -R spec test-*.coffee

You can also use this with the **-w** flag to have mocha watch for file changes and re-run the tests.

The slides from the meeting can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/code-dojo-25). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
